      <description>Data Transfer Objects PrestaShop is using Data Transfer Objects (DTO in short) in its codebase, in this section you learn how you can benefit from using DTOs as well.
What is Data Transfer Object? Data Transfer Object is object (e.g. UserData) that contains data in a structured format. This means that DTO usually comes with getter methods or public properties for accessing it&amp;rsquo;s data. The main benefit of using DTOs is that you know what data it has.</description>
