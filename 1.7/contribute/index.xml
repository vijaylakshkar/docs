      <description>How to become a Core Contributor using Docker If you&amp;rsquo;re reading this, thank you! This means you&amp;rsquo;re interested on contributing to PrestaShop. You probably are a PrestaShop developer, and your use of the project is slighty different from ours.

This is because we create a release usable by everyone from our sources.</description>
